    "# First Step\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson outlines the initial steps for creating a basic chatbot using Python and the OpenAI API, specifically without relying on the LangChain framework at this stage. The primary goal is to familiarize users with the fundamental components and workings of OpenAI's API, which is crucial for understanding its integration into more complex frameworks like LangChain and for developing custom AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💚 **Environment Management**: It is recommended to use separate virtual environments for individual projects. This practice helps prevent package conflicts, allows for different Python versions and package sets per project, and protects the base system setup, ensuring smoother development and deployment.\n",
    "- 🔑 **API Key Configuration**: The lesson emphasizes setting the OpenAI API key as an environment variable and then loading it into the Python script. This is a secure and standard method for authorizing API calls, essential for any interaction with OpenAI's models.\n",
    "- 🤖 **OpenAI Client Initialization**: To interact with the OpenAI API, an `OpenAIClient` instance must be created using `openai.OpenAI()`. This client object serves as the primary interface for making API requests, such as generating chat completions.\n",
    "- 💬 **Chat Completion API Usage**: The core of the chatbot functionality is achieved through the `client.chat.completions.create()` method. This method sends requests to a specified OpenAI model (e.g., GPT-4) to generate responses based on the provided input messages.\n",
    "- 📜 **Message Structuring for API Calls**: The `messages` parameter within the `create()` method is crucial for guiding the model. It expects a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary must contain `role` and `content` key-value pairs to structure the conversation and instructions.\n",
    "- 🎭 **Understanding Message Roles**: The `role` key in the `messages` input can be `system`, `user`, `assistant`, or `tool`. This lesson focuses on `system` (to set overall behavior), `user` (to pose questions or give commands), and `assistant` (to provide example responses or continue dialogue). Properly using these roles is fundamental to controlling the chatbot's responses and persona.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conceptual Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Structuring (the `messages` parameter)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is this concept important to know or understand?**\n",
    "The `messages` parameter is the primary mechanism for communicating with the OpenAI chat models. It's how you provide context, instructions, user queries, and even examples of desired responses. Understanding its structure is essential for crafting effective prompts and achieving desired model behavior.\n",
    "- **How does it connect with real-world tasks, problems, or applications?**\n",
    "In any application involving conversational AI (e.g., customer support bots, virtual assistants, educational tools), the `messages` array is used to manage the flow of conversation, provide the AI with necessary background information, and guide its responses. For instance, a system message can define the bot's persona, while user messages carry the customer's queries.\n",
    "- **What other concepts, techniques, or areas is this related to?**\n",
    "This is directly related to **Prompt Engineering**, where the quality of the input `messages` heavily dictates the output. It's also linked to **Context Management** in LLMs (how much of the prior conversation to include) and **State Management** in building interactive conversational agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role Definition (`system`, `user`, `assistant`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is this concept important to know or understand?**\n",
    "Distinguishing between `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles allows for a nuanced way to instruct the model. The `system` role sets the overarching behavior or persona of the AI. The `user` role represents the input from the end-user. The `assistant` role can be used to store previous AI responses or to provide examples of desired outputs (few-shot prompting).\n",
    "- **How does it connect with real-world tasks, problems, or applications?**\n",
    "    - **System Role**: Define a chatbot as a \"sarcastic history tutor,\" a \"formal financial advisor,\" or a \"friendly children's storyteller.\" This initial instruction shapes all subsequent interactions.\n",
    "    - **User Role**: Transmit the actual questions or commands from a person interacting with the chatbot, e.g., \"What was the weather like yesterday?\" or \"Write a poem about robots.\"\n",
    "    - **Assistant Role**: Store the bot's previous responses to maintain conversational context, or provide examples like: `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Translate 'hello' to French.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Bonjour.\"}` to guide the model's response style or capability.\n",
    "- **What other concepts, techniques, or areas is this related to?**\n",
    "This relates to **Persona Development** in AI, **Instruction Following** (system prompts act as high-level instructions), and **Few-Shot Prompting** (using assistant messages to show examples). It is a fundamental aspect of **Conversational Design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Code Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcript describes the following Python code setup and usage for interacting with the OpenAI API:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In a Jupyter Notebook cell, load the dotenv extension and the .env file\n",
    "# %load_ext dotenv\n",
    "# %dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import necessary libraries\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure the OpenAI API key from an environment variable\n",
    "# Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your .env file or system environment\n",
    "openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an OpenAI client instance\n",
    "client = openai.OpenAI()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the messages for the chatbot\n",
    "# This example sets a system message for a sarcastic assistant and a user question\n",
    "messages_for_chatbot = [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful, but brilliantly sarcastic assistant.\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you tell me who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020?\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a chat completion request\n",
    "# You can choose different models like \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" as well\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-4\",  # Or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", etc. Be mindful of costs.\n",
    "    messages=messages_for_chatbot\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# To access the chatbot's response (the transcript implies this would be the next step):\n",
    "# response_content = completion.choices[0].message.content\n",
    "# print(response_content)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Reflective Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can I apply this concept in my daily data science work or learning?**\n",
    "You can leverage the OpenAI API to automate text summarization, generate synthetic data for model training, draft reports, get explanations for complex code or concepts, or even create simple tools to assist with data cleaning and preprocessing tasks by describing the task in natural language.\n",
    "- **Can I explain this concept to a beginner in one sentence?**\n",
    "We're learning to use Python to send instructions and questions to a powerful AI (like ChatGPT) and get its intelligent responses back, which lets us build our own custom AI-powered applications.\n",
    "- **Which type of project or domain would this concept be most relevant to?**\n",
    "This concept is highly relevant for projects requiring natural language processing, such as building customer service chatbots, content generation tools (for marketing, creative writing), automated email responders, interactive educational software, or tools for sentiment analysis and text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "# System, user, and assistant roles\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment explains the distinct roles of `system`, `user`, and `assistant` messages within OpenAI's Chat Completion API. Properly utilizing these roles allows developers to direct the model's overall behavior, provide specific user inputs, and offer example interactions (few-shot prompting) to guide the AI towards desired response styles and formats, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and relevance of its outputs for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 👑 **System Role**: This role is used to provide high-level directives to the AI model. It defines the model's overall purpose, its persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant,\" \"You are Marv, a sarcastic chatbot\"), the desired output format, and any other overarching instructions that should guide its responses throughout the conversation. Its utility lies in pre-conditioning the model for a specific task or interaction style.\n",
    "- 👤 **User Role**: The `user` role represents the input provided by the person interacting with the chatbot or AI system. This content can range from direct questions, statements needing completion or correction, to instructions for a specific task, forming the immediate prompt the AI needs to address.\n",
    "- 💡 **Assistant Role for Few-Shot Prompting**: `Assistant` messages can be strategically used to provide the model with concrete examples of desired outputs or to give additional context. By showing the model pairs of `user` inputs and ideal `assistant` responses, developers can guide its writing style and improve performance on specific tasks, like sentiment analysis, without needing extensive training data.\n",
    "- 🗣️ **Assistant Role for Model Responses**: The AI's own generated responses are also logged with the `assistant` role. This is crucial for maintaining conversational history, allowing the model (and the developer) to refer to previous turns in the dialogue, ensuring context is preserved in ongoing interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conceptual Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Power of Differentiated Message Roles (`system`, `user`, `assistant`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is this concept important to know or understand?**\n",
    "This role-based structure is fundamental for precise communication with Large Language Models. The `system` message sets the AI's baseline behavior and persona. `User` messages deliver the specific tasks or queries. `Assistant` messages (whether provided as examples or generated by the AI) help refine the model's understanding, demonstrate desired output styles, and maintain the flow of conversation. This separation allows for more nuanced control over the AI's responses compared to a single, undifferentiated prompt, leading to more reliable and tailored outcomes.\n",
    "- **How does it connect with real-world tasks, problems, or applications?**\n",
    "    - **Custom Chatbots:** A `system` message defines the chatbot's character (e.g., \"You are a patient math tutor for 5th graders\"). `User` messages are the student's questions. `Assistant` messages are the bot's helpful replies and can also be used to pre-load examples of good explanations.\n",
    "    - **Task-Specific AI Tools:** For an email drafting assistant, the `system` message might be \"You are a professional business communication assistant. Draft polite and concise emails.\" The `user` provides the key points for the email.\n",
    "    - **Few-Shot Learning/In-Context Learning:** When fine-tuning is not feasible, providing examples via `user` and `assistant` message pairs (e.g., for classifying customer reviews, translating with a specific tone) can significantly improve the model's performance on specialized tasks by showing, not just telling, what's expected.\n",
    "- **What other concepts, techniques, or areas is this related to?**\n",
    "This structured approach is central to **Prompt Engineering**. It's a practical method for **Instruction Tuning** (where `system` messages act as guiding instructions) and enabling **Few-Shot Learning** or **In-Context Learning**. It's also a core component of **Conversational AI Design**, influencing how context is managed (within the model's **Context Window**) and how the AI's behavior is shaped without needing to retrain the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Code Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcript explains the structure of messages using these roles. Below are conceptual examples in a JSON-like format, representing how these messages would be structured in an API call:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Sarcastic Chatbot Persona (Marv)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Marv, a chatbot that reluctantly answers questions with sarcastic responses.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the capital of France?\"}\n",
    "  // Expected model response would be in an \"assistant\" role, with a sarcastic tone.\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: Sentiment Analysis using Few-Shot Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You will be provided with a tweet, and your task is to classify its sentiment as positive, neutral or negative.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"This new movie is extraordinary.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"positive\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"This new album is all right.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"neutral\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"This new book could not have been written worse.\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"negative\"},\n",
    "  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"This new song blew my mind.\"}\n",
    "  // Expected model response: {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"positive\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Reflective Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can I apply this concept in my daily data science work or learning?**\n",
    "AI Answer: You can use distinct roles to better control LLM outputs for various tasks: set a `system` message to define an expert persona (e.g., \"You are a data visualization expert using Matplotlib\"), use `user` messages for your specific queries (e.g., \"How can I create a bar chart with error bars?\"), and even add `assistant` examples to show preferred code styles or explanation formats.\n",
    "- **Can I explain this concept to a beginner in one sentence?**\n",
    "AI Answer: By telling an AI its main job (`system` role), what you specifically want (`user` role), and showing it examples of good answers (`assistant` role), you can get much better and more specific responses from it.\n",
    "- **Which type of project or domain would this concept be most relevant to?**\n",
    "AI Answer: This is most relevant for developing specialized AI applications such as custom chatbots for customer support or education, tools for content generation with specific styles (e.g., marketing copy, technical documentation), interactive storytelling, or any system where the AI's tone, task-focus, and response accuracy need to be carefully managed, especially for classification or generation tasks demonstrated via examples.\n",

    "# Creating a sarcastic chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson details the practical steps for implementing a sarcastic chatbot named \"Marv\" within a Jupyter Notebook using Python and the OpenAI API. It covers structuring the `messages` list with `system` and `user` roles, executing the chat completion request, and then thoroughly inspecting the `ChatCompletion` response object to extract the AI's reply, while also highlighting parameters like `n` for multiple responses and the availability of token usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📝 **Crafting Input Messages**: The process begins by creating a list of message dictionaries. The first sets the chatbot's persona using the `system` role (e.g., \"You are Marv, a chatbot that reluctantly answers questions with sarcastic responses\"), and the second poses a question using the `user` role (e.g., \"Could you suggest some dog names?\"). This structured input is essential for guiding the model.\n",
    "- ▶️ **Executing and Retrieving the Chat Completion**: The `client.chat.completions.create()` method is called with the specified model and messages. This action queries the OpenAI API and returns a `ChatCompletion` object containing the AI's response and associated metadata.\n",
    "- 🔍 **Understanding the Response Object Structure**: The `ChatCompletion` object returned by the API has a specific structure. Crucially, it contains a `choices` attribute, which is a list of `Choice` objects. Each `Choice` object then holds a `message` attribute, where the AI's actual content and its `role` (which will be `assistant`) are found.\n",
    "- 💬 **Extracting the AI's Content**: To get the chatbot's textual answer, one needs to navigate this structure: typically `completion.choices[0].message.content`. Applying `print()` to this string ensures it's displayed in a readable format.\n",
    "- ⚙️ **Controlling Number of Responses (`n`)**: The API allows requesting multiple different responses to the same prompt by setting the `n` parameter in the `create` call. While this offers variety, it's important to note that generating more responses consumes more tokens and thus incurs higher costs.\n",
    "- 📊 **Monitoring Token Usage**: The response object includes information about `completion_tokens`, `prompt_tokens`, and `total_tokens`. This data is valuable for tracking API usage and managing costs effectively.\n",
    "- 📚 **Reinforcing Learning (Homework)**: A practical exercise is suggested: implement the tweet classifier (from a previous example) to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, thereby encouraging hands-on application of the concepts discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conceptual Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigating the `ChatCompletion` Response Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is this concept important to know or understand?**\n",
    "The OpenAI API doesn't return just the AI's text; it returns a structured `ChatCompletion` object. Understanding this object's schema—specifically how `choices`, `message`, `content`, and `role` are nested—is critical for programmatically accessing the AI-generated text. It also provides access to other vital information like why the model stopped generating (finish reason), token counts, and the model used, allowing for robust application development.\n",
    "- **How does it connect with real-world tasks, problems, or applications?**\n",
    "In any application integrating OpenAI's chat models, developers must parse this response object. For instance, a customer service bot would extract the `content` to display to a user. A content generation tool might use `n > 1` to offer several alternatives. Cost management systems would log the `usage` (token) data. Error handling might involve checking the `finish_reason` to see if a response was truncated due to length limits.\n",
    "- **What other concepts, techniques, or areas is this related to?**\n",
    "This relates to **API interaction patterns** (how services provide data), **JSON parsing** (as the underlying format of the API response is JSON, which the Python SDK abstracts into objects), and general principles of working with **structured data**. It's a practical example of how SDKs simplify interaction with web services by converting raw responses into more manageable objects.\n",

    "- **How can I apply this concept in my daily data science work or learning?**\n",
    "AI Answer: You can directly use the OpenAI API as shown to quickly prototype natural language processing features, generate varied textual datasets for experiments by tweaking system/user prompts, or even build simple tools to automate summarization or rephrasing tasks within your Python scripts and notebooks.\n",
    "- **Can I explain this concept to a beginner in one sentence?**\n",
    "AI Answer: We're teaching a computer program (our chatbot \"Marv\") its personality, asking it a question about dog names, and then learning how to find and read its funny, sarcastic answer from the complex package of information the AI sends back.\n",
    "- **Which type of project or domain would this concept be most relevant to?**\n",
    "AI Answer: This is highly relevant for projects involving the development of custom conversational AI, interactive applications (like games or educational tools with AI characters), content generation systems requiring specific personas, or any scenario where you need to precisely instruct an AI and parse its detailed response object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Temperature, max tokens, and streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explores advanced parameters for fine-tuning OpenAI model responses beyond basic message roles. It covers `max_tokens` for controlling output length and managing API costs, `temperature` and `seed` for adjusting the randomness and reproducibility of responses, and the `stream` parameter for enabling real-time, continuous output delivery. Mastering these parameters allows developers to create more controlled, cost-effective, and user-friendly AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Highlights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🪙 **`max_tokens`**: This parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens the model is allowed to generate in its completion. It's essential for controlling the verbosity of the AI's response, managing API costs (as you're typically charged per token for output), and ensuring the output fits within desired length constraints. Setting it too low can result in incomplete responses.\n",
    "- 🌡️ **`temperature`**: This setting, typically ranging from 0 to 2, controls the randomness of the model's output. Lower values (e.g., 0) make the output more focused, deterministic, and suitable for factual content or when consistency is key. Higher values increase creativity and diversity but can lead to less coherent or off-topic responses if set excessively high. The default is often 1.\n",
    "- 🌱 **`seed`**: The `seed` parameter is used in conjunction with `temperature` to promote more reproducible outputs. By setting a specific integer value for `seed` (especially with a low `temperature` like 0), you can make the model's responses as consistent as possible across multiple identical requests, which is beneficial for testing, debugging, and when predictable outputs are desired. Perfect determinism is not always guaranteed with LLMs, however.\n",
    "- 🌊 **`stream`**: Setting `stream=True` in the API call causes the model to send back its response incrementally, as a series of `ChatCompletionChunk` objects, rather than waiting for the entire text to be generated. This is crucial for creating a responsive user experience in applications like chatbots, as users see text appearing token-by-token.\n",
    "- 🔄 **Handling Streamed Responses**: When `stream=True`, the API returns a `Stream` object that must be iterated (e.g., using a `for` loop). Each `chunk` in the stream contains a `delta` attribute (instead of a `message` attribute seen in non-streamed responses), and the actual text piece is found in `chunk.choices[0].delta.content`. These pieces must be concatenated to form the complete response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conceptual Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`temperature` and Its Impact on Output Creativity vs. Predictability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why is this concept important to know or understand?**`Temperature` is a critical lever for controlling the \"personality\" of the model's output. A low temperature constrains the model to pick higher-probability tokens, leading to more predictable, conservative, and often factual text. A high temperature allows the model to explore lower-probability tokens, increasing randomness, novelty, and \"creativity,\" but also the risk of nonsensical or irrelevant output.

    "- **How does it connect with real-world tasks, problems, or applications?**\n",
    "    - **Low Temperature (e.g., 0.0 - 0.5):** Ideal for tasks requiring accuracy and consistency, such as factual Q&amp;A, code generation, summarization of technical documents, or translation.\n",
    "    - **Medium Temperature (e.g., 0.6 - 1.0):** A balance for creative yet coherent text, like writing assistance, marketing copy, or chatbots that need to be engaging but still on-topic.\n",
    "    - **High Temperature (e.g., 1.1 - 2.0):** Used for brainstorming, poetry generation, or exploring highly novel ideas, but requires careful management to avoid incoherence.\n",
    "- **What other concepts, techniques, or areas is this related to?**\n",
    "This relates to the underlying **sampling strategies** used by language models during text generation. `Temperature` modifies the probability distribution of the next token. It's often used alongside other sampling parameters like `top_p` (nucleus sampling), which provides another way to control the set of tokens considered for generation.\n",

    "- **Why is this concept important to know or understand?**\n",
    "In interactive applications, user perceived latency is critical. Streaming responses means users start seeing output almost immediately, making the AI feel much faster and more engaging, rather than staring at a loading indicator while the full response generates. This mimics the natural flow of conversation.\n",
    "- **How does it connect with real-world tasks, problems, or applications?**\n",
    "Streaming is fundamental for:\n",
    "    - **Chatbots:** Providing instant feedback makes the conversation feel more natural.\n",
    "    - **Live Coding Assistants:** Showing code suggestions as they are being formed.\n",
    "    - **Content Generation Tools:** Allowing users to see long-form text (articles, stories) unfold in real-time.\n",
    "    It significantly improves user satisfaction and engagement in any application where the AI generates text for direct human consumption.\n",
    "- **What other concepts, techniques, or areas is this related to?**\n",
    "This is closely related to **asynchronous processing** and **real-time communication protocols** (like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events on the web). Programmatically, it requires handling data in chunks and often involves updating the UI dynamically as new pieces of information arrive.\n",

    "## **Reflective Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can I apply this concept in my daily data science work or learning?**\n",
    "AI Answer: You can use `max_tokens` to ensure generated text fits specific length requirements for reports or summaries. Experiment with `temperature` and `seed` to control the creativity versus consistency of generated content, for example, when creating synthetic datasets or brainstorming research ideas. Implement `stream=True` when building interactive data exploration tools or educational demos to make them more responsive.\n",
    "- **Can I explain this concept to a beginner in one sentence?**\n",
    "AI Answer: We're learning to fine-tune our AI's responses by setting a word limit (`max_tokens`), adjusting its creativity level (`temperature`), making its answers more predictable (`seed`), and making it type out answers live like a real person (`stream`).\n",
    "- **Which type of project or domain would this concept be most relevant to?**\n",
    "AI Answer: These parameters are vital across many domains: `max_tokens` for any application with cost or length constraints; `temperature` and `seed` for balancing creativity and consistency in fields like content creation, education, or technical support; and `stream` for enhancing user experience in any real-time interactive application like chatbots, virtual assistants, or live educational platforms."
