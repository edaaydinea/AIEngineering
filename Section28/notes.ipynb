    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces deep learning, also known as neural networks, and its potential impact on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Deep learning models, inspired by the human brain, use interconnected layers of neurons to analyze data and uncover patterns. Different architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data like language exist. Training these models involves optimizing the weights between neurons to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. Advancements in hardware have enabled more complex deep learning models capable of handling large datasets, leading to significant progress in various fields, including NLP. The next lesson will delve into the specific advancements of deep learning in NLP. There were no code examples mentioned in this text.\n",
