    "# Models and Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explains OpenAI's pricing structure, which is based on token consumption, where a token is roughly three-quarters of a word. It highlights that costs vary by model and are different for input (prompts) and output (responses), emphasizing the importance of understanding these factors, along with model training data freshness and context window limits, when selecting an LLM for a project. The primary model discussed for course use is GPT-4o, with its capabilities and pricing as of its latest updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- ü™ô **Token Definition:** A token is the basic unit for processing and pricing in LLMs, roughly equivalent to 43 of a word (100 tokens ‚âà 75 words). This is fundamental for estimating and managing costs in any LLM-based application.\n",
    "- üí≤ **Pricing Model:** OpenAI charges based on the number of input and output tokens, with output tokens typically being more expensive. For instance, as of late 2024/early 2025, a common `gpt-4o` model (e.g., `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`) costs approximately $2.50 per million input tokens and $10.00 per million output tokens. This pricing is crucial for budgeting AI projects.\n",
    "- üñºÔ∏è **Context Window Limit:** Each model has a maximum context window, which is the total number of tokens (shared between input and output) it can handle in a single interaction. For GPT-4o, this limit is 128,000 tokens. Understanding this limit is vital for designing prompts and managing conversation history in data science applications to avoid errors and ensure the model can process the required information.\n",
    "- üß† **Model Selection Criteria:** Key factors for choosing a language model include:\n",
    "    - Price per input and output tokens.\n",
    "    - The cut-off date of the training data (for GPT-4o, this is October 2023, meaning it lacks knowledge of events or data beyond this date).\n",
    "    - The context window limit.\n",
    "    These factors directly impact the cost-effectiveness and capabilities of the chosen model for specific tasks like Q&A over recent documents, or long-form content generation.\n",
    "- ‚öôÔ∏è **GPT-4o:** Identified as OpenAI's efficient, advanced, and (more recently) more affordable flagship model. It will be the primary model used in the practical parts of the course, though other models can be easily substituted.\n",
    "- <0xF0><0x9F><0xA7><0xB2> **Embedding Models:** The course will also utilize embedding models like `text-embedding-3-small` for representing text as numerical vectors, a core concept in semantic search and other NLP tasks. This is useful for finding similar documents or powering RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why are tokens and context windows important to understand?**\n",
    "    - Tokens directly translate to cost. The more tokens in your input (e.g., detailed instructions, large documents) or generated by the output, the higher the operational expense. The context window defines the upper limit of information (both prompt and completion) the model can consider at once. Exceeding it will lead to errors or loss of information from earlier parts of the input.\n",
    "- **How do these concepts connect with real-world tasks?**\n",
    "    - For a chatbot analyzing a lengthy legal document to answer questions, the document's length (token count) must fit within the model's context window. The cost will be determined by the document's token count (input) and the answer's token count (output). If the document is too large, strategies like chunking and embedding (related to RAG) become necessary.\n",
    "- **What other concepts are these related to?**\n",
    "    - **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting concise yet effective prompts helps manage token count and cost.\n",
    "    - **Data Preprocessing:** For large texts, techniques like summarization or chunking are needed to fit data within the context window.\n",
    "    - **Cost Optimization:** Choosing models with appropriate context window sizes and pricing for the task is key.\n",
    "    - **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses embeddings and context windows to provide relevant external data to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflective Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can I apply this concept in my daily data science work or learning?**\n",
    "    - AI Answer: When using LLMs, always estimate the token count of your inputs and anticipated outputs to predict costs. Choose models whose context windows and pricing align with your project's needs and budget constraints, especially when dealing with large datasets or requiring extensive outputs.\n",
    "- **Can I explain this concept to a beginner in one sentence?**\n",
    "    - AI Answer: LLMs understand and generate text by breaking it into \"tokens\" (like word pieces), and you pay based on how many tokens you send in and get back, with each model having a limit on how many tokens it can remember at once.\n",
    "- **Which type of project or domain would this concept be most relevant to?**\n",
    "    - AI Answer: This is relevant to any project using LLMs, but especially critical for applications involving large text analysis (e.g., legal document review, medical research summarization), continuous conversational AI (e.g., customer service bots that need to remember long histories), or cost-sensitive production deployments in any domain."
