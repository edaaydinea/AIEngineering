    "# How large is an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are characterized by their size, which is measured by the number of parameters they possess. These parameters are like tiny pieces of information that enable the model to understand and generate language. LLMs have millions to trillions of parameters, with models like BERT having 345 million and GPT-4 reaching 1.7 trillion. Additionally, LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, including books, websites, articles, social media, and more, allowing them to learn the patterns, grammar, and vocabulary of human language on a massive scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔢 The size of an LLM is determined by its number of parameters, which are fundamental units of information for language processing.\n",
    "- 🧠 A larger number of parameters generally equates to a better ability to understand and work with language.\n",
    "- 🌐 LLMs are trained on enormous datasets of text from diverse sources across the internet.\n",

    "# General purpose models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The second key characteristic of large language models (LLMs) is their general-purpose nature. This means they are trained on a diverse range of internet text data, enabling them to understand and generate human language in a versatile way across various tasks. Unlike models trained for specific tasks like classification, LLMs are initially pre-trained to acquire a broad understanding of knowledge and language. This general understanding then allows for fine-tuning the LLM for more specific applications or industries.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📚 The transcript mentions training a model for specific tasks like \"classification or clustering,\" which are common machine learning applications. In Python, libraries like Scikit-learn (`sklearn`) provide tools for these tasks. For example, a classification task might involve code like:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",

    "# Pre-training and fine tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-training and fine-tuning are key processes in developing large language models (LLMs). Pre-training involves exposing the model to vast amounts of internet text data, allowing it to learn fundamental aspects of language such as grammar, vocabulary, and common sense by predicting the next words in sentences. This phase is analogous to the broad education received in early schooling. Fine-tuning then involves training the pre-trained model on smaller, specialized datasets to excel in specific tasks or industries like medicine or customer service. This is similar to focusing on specific subjects for a chosen career, building upon the foundational knowledge. Notably, due to their extensive pre-training, LLMs can sometimes perform well in \"few-shot\" or \"zero-shot\" scenarios with minimal or no additional task-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Code Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🌐 The pre-training phase involves processing large amounts of text data. While the transcript doesn't provide specific code, this often involves techniques for data loading, cleaning, and feeding it into the LLM architecture. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, along with libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers, are commonly used for this. An abstract example of loading text data might look like:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
